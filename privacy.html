    We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how this website works.

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any of the following:</p>
  <p>• Personal data (names, emails, phone numbers)<br/>
     • Payment information<br/>
     • Login or account details<br/>

  <h2>2. Affiliate Links</h2>
  <p>
    Gifted Hands Innovation participates in the Amazon Associates Program. Some links on our website
    may be affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if you make a purchase. This
    does <strong>not</strong> increase the price you pay.

  <p>
    Amazon may use its own cookies and tracking technologies. Please refer to Amazon’s own
    Privacy Policy for details on how they process data.

  <h2>3. Third-Party Websites</h2>
  <p>
    Our site contains links to Amazon and possibly other retailers. We are not responsible for the
    content, privacy practices, or security measures of those third-party websites. You should review
    their policies separately.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    We do not directly use cookies or tracking technologies on this static website. However, third-party
    sites we link to (such as Amazon) may use cookies. Those cookies are controlled by the respective
    third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect personal information, no user data is stored on our servers. Our website
    is hosted via GitHub Pages, which uses secure industry-standard infrastructure.
